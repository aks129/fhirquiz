# FHIR Healthcare Bootcamp Lab Checklist

## Day 1: Ingest & Land âœ…

### Step 1: Server Setup
- [ ] Select a public FHIR test server from dropdown
- [ ] Test server connectivity using the "Test Connection" button
- [ ] Verify CapabilityStatement retrieval shows FHIR R4 support
- [ ] **Screenshot Required:** Server connection success message with FHIR version

### Step 2: Bundle Upload
- [ ] Upload the provided Synthea patient bundle OR use "Load Sample" button
- [ ] Verify successful bundle transaction (all resources created)
- [ ] Note the resource IDs returned from server
- [ ] Confirm patient data appears in FHIR server

### Step 3: Data Export
- [ ] Export Patients CSV (should contain patient demographics)
- [ ] Export Encounters CSV (should contain visit information)
- [ ] Export Observations CSV (should contain vital signs and lab results)
- [ ] Verify CSV files contain expected data structure

## Day 2: Transform & Analyze âš¡

### Step 1: Staging Tables
- [ ] Review the provided SQL for staging table creation
- [ ] Execute staging table creation using the "Create Staging Tables" button
- [ ] Verify staging tables contain imported CSV data
- [ ] **Screenshot Required:** SQL staging table preview with sample data

### Step 2: Risk Score Calculation
- [ ] Execute risk score calculation SQL
- [ ] Review generated risk scores for patients
- [ ] Understand how condition codes contribute to risk scoring
- [ ] Verify risk categories (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH) are assigned correctly

### Step 3: Readmission Analysis
- [ ] Execute readmission flag calculation SQL
- [ ] Review 30-day readmission predictions
- [ ] Understand how encounter timing drives readmission logic
- [ ] Correlate readmission flags with risk scores

## Day 3: Operationalize ðŸš€

### Step 1: Observation Creation
- [ ] Configure observation with appropriate LOINC code (72133-2 for Risk Assessment)
- [ ] Map computed risk score to FHIR valueQuantity
- [ ] Ensure proper patient and encounter references
- [ ] Publish observation to FHIR server

### Step 2: Resource Validation
- [ ] Verify published observation appears on FHIR server
- [ ] Check resource URL is accessible and valid
- [ ] Confirm observation links correctly to patient
- [ ] **Screenshot Required:** Published observation resource on FHIR server

### Step 3: Interoperability Validation
- [ ] Understand CodeableConcept structure in your observation
- [ ] Verify LOINC codes enable cross-system compatibility
- [ ] Review how your observation could be consumed by other systems

## Results Gallery Preparation ðŸ“¸

### Required Screenshots (for LinkedIn/Portfolio)
1. **Server Connection Success**: CapabilityStatement ping with FHIR version displayed
2. **Transform Results**: SQL query results showing risk scores and readmission flags
3. **Published Observation**: FHIR Observation resource visible on server with your risk assessment

### Portfolio Artifacts
- [ ] Download CSV exports from Day 1
- [ ] Download transform results from Day 2 
- [ ] Download published observation JSON from Day 3
- [ ] Generate LinkedIn completion post using the built-in generator

## LinkedIn Post Checklist ðŸ“±

### Content to Include
- [ ] Mention completion percentage (aim for 100%!)
- [ ] Highlight specific technical skills gained (FHIR, Synthea, SQL transforms)
- [ ] Credit Darren Devitt for expert guidance
- [ ] Include relevant hashtags: #FHIR #HealthcareIT #Interoperability #HealthTech
- [ ] Add link to your repository or portfolio
- [ ] Tag relevant connections in healthcare tech

### Professional Impact
- [ ] Demonstrate understanding of healthcare interoperability
- [ ] Show ability to work with standardized healthcare data
- [ ] Highlight experience with real-world FHIR workflows
- [ ] Position yourself for HealthTech opportunities

## Troubleshooting Quick Reference ðŸ”§

### Common Issues
- **Connection Failed**: Try different server from dropdown, check URL format
- **Bundle Upload Rejected**: Verify JSON structure, check FHIR version compatibility
- **Empty CSV Export**: Confirm patient data exists, check patient ID format
- **Transform Errors**: Review SQL syntax, verify CSV column names match
- **Observation Creation Failed**: Check required fields, verify server supports POST

### Best Practices Followed
- [ ] Only used synthetic/test data (never real patient information)
- [ ] Tested server connectivity before each major operation
- [ ] Validated data at each step before proceeding
- [ ] Handled errors gracefully with appropriate user feedback
- [ ] Documented learning process for future reference
