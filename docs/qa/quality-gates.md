# Quality Gates Configuration

## Overview

Quality gates are automated checks that ensure code quality standards are met before deployment. This document defines the specific criteria and thresholds for the FHIR Healthcare Bootcamp project.

## Quality Gate Criteria

### 1. Code Coverage

**Requirement**: Minimum 80% line coverage for unit tests

**Measurement**: 
- Unit tests coverage via Vitest + c8
- Integration tests coverage tracked separately
- Combined coverage must exceed 80%

**Enforcement**:
- CI pipeline blocks merge if coverage falls below threshold
- Coverage reports generated for each build
- Trending analysis to prevent coverage degradation

```bash
# Check coverage locally
npm run test:coverage
```

### 2. Test Pass Rates

**Requirements**:
- Unit tests: 100% pass rate (no exceptions)
- Integration tests: 95% pass rate
- E2E tests: 95% pass rate
- Performance tests: 90% pass rate

**Measurement**:
- Test result aggregation from multiple test suites
- Flaky test identification and remediation
- Test execution time monitoring

### 3. Accessibility Compliance

**Requirement**: Zero critical accessibility violations

**Standards**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

**Tools**:
- @axe-core/playwright for automated testing
- Manual testing for complex interactions
- Screen reader compatibility verification

**Violations Blocked**:
- Level A violations: Immediate failure
- Level AA violations: Immediate failure
- Level AAA violations: Warning only

### 4. Performance Standards

**Requirements**:
- Lighthouse Performance Score: â‰¥ 90
- First Contentful Paint (FCP): < 1.5 seconds
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): < 2.5 seconds
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): < 0.1
- Total Blocking Time (TBT): < 200ms

**Measurement Environment**:
- Simulated 3G network
- CPU throttling (4x slowdown)
- Desktop and mobile testing

### 5. Security Requirements

**Requirements**:
- Zero high-severity security vulnerabilities
- Maximum 5 medium-severity vulnerabilities
- No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- Dependencies must be up-to-date (< 30 days old)

**Tools**:
- npm audit for dependency vulnerabilities
- Snyk for advanced security scanning
- Git secret scanning
- OWASP dependency check

### 6. Code Quality Metrics

**Requirements**:
- TypeScript errors: 0
- ESLint errors: 0
- ESLint warnings: < 10
- Complexity score: < 15 (cyclomatic complexity)
- Maintainability index: > 70

**Static Analysis**:
- TypeScript compiler checks
- ESLint with recommended rules
- Code complexity analysis
- Dead code detection

### 7. FHIR Compliance

**Requirements**:
- All FHIR resources validate against R4 schemas
- Bundle operations succeed on test servers
- Observation resources contain required fields
- Patient resources include minimum required data

**Validation**:
- FHIR validator integration
- Server compatibility testing
- Resource schema validation
- Terminology validation (LOINC, SNOMED)

## Implementation Details

### CI/CD Pipeline Gates

```yaml
# Quality gate implementation in GitHub Actions
quality-gates:
  steps:
    - name: Check Coverage
      run: |
        COVERAGE=$(jq -r '.total.lines.pct' coverage/coverage-summary.json)
        if (( $(echo "$COVERAGE < 80" | bc -l) )); then
          echo "Coverage below 80%: $COVERAGE%"
          exit 1
        fi
    
    - name: Check Test Pass Rates
      run: |
        # Implementation details for test rate checking
        
    - name: Check Accessibility
      run: |
        # Axe-core violation checking
        
    - name: Check Performance
      run: |
        # Lighthouse score validation
```

### Local Development Gates

```bash
# Pre-commit hooks
npm run qa:check
```

Pre-commit script verifies:
- TypeScript compilation
- Lint rules
- Unit test execution
- Basic accessibility checks

### Quality Gate Dashboard

Metrics tracking dashboard shows:
- Historical coverage trends
- Test stability metrics
- Performance regression tracking
- Accessibility compliance trends
- Security vulnerability trends

## Gate Failure Handling

### Temporary Bypass

In exceptional circumstances, quality gates can be bypassed with:
- Technical lead approval
- Documented justification
- Remediation plan with timeline
- Risk assessment

```bash
# Emergency bypass (requires approval)
git commit -m "feat: critical fix [skip-gates]"
```

### Remediation Process

When gates fail:

1. **Immediate Response**
   - Block deployment automatically
   - Notify development team
   - Create tracking issue

2. **Root Cause Analysis**
   - Identify failure source
   - Document impact assessment
   - Plan remediation steps

3. **Resolution**
   - Implement fixes
   - Verify gate compliance
   - Update prevention measures

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Real-time Monitoring

- Quality gate status dashboard
- Slack notifications for failures
- Email alerts for persistent issues
- Trending analysis reports

### Reporting

**Daily Reports**:
- Gate status summary
- Trend analysis
- Action items

**Weekly Reports**:
- Quality metrics dashboard
- Performance trends
- Security posture review

**Monthly Reports**:
- Quality gate effectiveness analysis
- Process improvement recommendations
- Benchmark comparisons

## Continuous Improvement

### Gate Effectiveness Review

Quarterly review of:
- Gate threshold appropriateness
- False positive/negative rates
- Development velocity impact
- Quality outcome correlation

### Threshold Adjustments

Process for modifying gates:
1. Data-driven analysis of current performance
2. Impact assessment on development workflow
3. Team consultation and consensus
4. Gradual rollout of changes
5. Monitoring of effects

## Tool Configuration

### Coverage Configuration
```json
{
  "coverage": {
    "threshold": {
      "global": {
        "lines": 80,
        "functions": 80,
        "branches": 75,
        "statements": 80
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Lint Configuration
```json
{
  "extends": ["@typescript-eslint/recommended"],
  "rules": {
    "complexity": ["error", 15],
    "max-depth": ["error", 4],
    "max-lines": ["error", 300]
  }
}
```

### Accessibility Configuration
```json
{
  "axe": {
    "rules": {
      "color-contrast": { "enabled": true },
      "keyboard-navigation": { "enabled": true },
      "aria-labels": { "enabled": true }
    }
  }
}
```

## Emergency Procedures

### Production Issues

If quality gates prevent critical production fixes:

1. **Immediate Action**
   - Document the emergency
   - Get technical lead approval
   - Apply temporary bypass
   - Deploy fix with monitoring

2. **Post-Emergency**
   - Conduct retrospective
   - Update gate configuration
   - Improve emergency procedures
   - Prevent future occurrences

### Gate System Failures

If the quality gate system itself fails:

1. Manual verification checklist
2. Temporary manual approval process
3. System restoration priority
4. Process documentation update

## Success Metrics

### Primary KPIs
- Gate compliance rate: > 95%
- False positive rate: < 5%
- Mean time to resolution: < 2 hours
- Development velocity impact: < 10%

### Secondary KPIs
- Bug escape rate reduction: 50%
- Security incident reduction: 80%
- Accessibility compliance improvement: 100%
- Customer satisfaction improvement: 15%

This quality gate system ensures consistent, high-quality deliveries while maintaining development velocity and team productivity.
